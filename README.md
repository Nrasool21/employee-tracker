## Description

I was tasked to create a Content Management System and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

``` npm run start```

## What We Did

-Design the following database schema containing three tables: department, roles & employee. 
- Built the following command-line application for the users: 
- Add departments, roles, employees
- View departments, roles, employees
- Update employee roles
- Used MySQL NPM package to connect to the MySQL database and perform queries.
- Used Inquirer NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.
- Used console.table to print MySQL rows to the console.
